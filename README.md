# What is JIRA Software?

JIRA is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by Atlassian. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions. Please visit [official](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver071/jira-software-documentation-800706335.html) documentation for more information.
_JIRA Software_ is intended for use by software development teams and includes _JIRA Core_ and _JIRA Agile_.

# How to use this image.

This image is based on official [java:8 (JDK)](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/java) and installs Atlassian JIRA Software 7.1.9. It is also enabled for use with reverse proxy by providing environment variables as explained further down in this README.
Reason why this Docker image has been established is that there are currently none official JIRA Software image from Atlassian and we wanted to do few tweaks of those unofficial images that exists on Docker Hub (see Credits below).

### Credits
We want to give credit to following Docker images that has been used as inspiration of this image:
- [atlassian/bitbucket-server](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/docker-atlassian-bitbucket-server)
- [cptactionhank/docker-atlassian-jira-software](https://github.com/cptactionhank/docker-atlassian-jira-software)
- [ahaasler/docker-jira](https://github.com/ahaasler/docker-jira)
- [mhubig/atlassian](https://github.com/mhubig/atlassian)

### Alt 1: Run container with minimum config

```console
$ docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 8080:8080 --name jira acntech/adop-jira
```

You are now ready to start configuration of JIRA (choosing license model and other initial configuration) by entering http://localhost:8080. We recommend that you look at logs (`docker logs jira -f`) while initial configuration is done to make sure everything is running smooth.

This will store the workspace in `/var/atlassian/application-data/jira`. All JIRA data lives in there - including plugins, configuration, attachments ++ (see [JIRA application home directory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/jira-application-home-directory-802593036.html) ). You will probably want to make that a persistent volume (recommended)

The `--restart=unless-stopped` option is set to automatically restart the docker container in case of failure and server reboot, but not if the container has been set to stop state. [More information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/restart-policies-restart).

### Alt 2: Run container with persisting volume

##### Mount a host directory as a data volume

This strategy is mostly suited for testing locally as the container will be dependent on the filesystem of the host. 
This might cause issues with regards to access rights on the mounted folder from the host filesystem. 

```console
$ docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 8080:8080 --name jira \
        -v "/var/lib/docker/data/jira:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira" \
        acntech/adop-jira
```
This will store the JIRA data in `/var/lib/docker/data/jira` on the host. 
Ensure that `/var/lib/docker/data/jira` is accessible by the `jira` user in container (`jira` user - uid `1000`) or use [-u](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/user) `some_other_user` parameter with `docker run`.

> WARNING! Please note that [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker), which is used to host Docker on Windows and Mac when spinning up new [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/), **removes** automatically **all folders** but `/var/lib/docker` and `/var/lib/boot2docker` in case of restarting the docker-machine. See [Persistent data](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker#persist-data) and [ServerFault thread](http://serverfault.com/questions/722085/why-does-docker-machine-clear-data-on-restart). See following example
```console
$ docker-machine ssh test-machine
$ docker run -v /data:/data --name mydata busybox true
$ docker run --volumes-from mydata busybox sh -c "echo hello >/data/hello"
$ docker run --volumes-from mydata busybox cat /data/hello
hello
$ docker run -v /var/lib/docker/data:/data --name mydata2 busybox true
$ docker run --volumes-from mydata2 busybox sh -c "echo hello >/data/hello"
$ docker run --volumes-from mydata2 busybox cat /data/hello
hello
$ docker-machine restart test-machine
$ docker-machine ssh test-machine
$ docker run --volumes-from mydata busybox cat /data/hello
cat: can't open '/data/hello': No such file or directory
$ docker run --volumes-from mydata2 busybox cat /data/hello
hello
```

##### Mount a docker data volume

Recommended approach for mounting data outside of the container. The data volume will exist even if you remove the container and the volume can easily be reused by other containers.
[More information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)

```console
$ docker volume create --name jira_volume
$ docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 80:8080 --name jira -v jira_volume:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira acntech/adop-jira
```
This will map the "jira_volume" to the containers "/var/atlassian/application-data/jira acntech/adop-jira" directory.

### Alt 3: Run container with reverse proxy

If you have a reverse proxy, such as [Nginx](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/integrating-jira-with-nginx-426115340.html) or [Apache HTTP Server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/integrating-apache-http-server-reverse-proxy-with-jira-753894357.html) in front of your JIRA application you need to provide proxy settings:

```console
$ docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 8080:8080 --name jira \
        -v "/var/lib/docker/data/jira:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira" \
        -e "X_PROXY_NAME=example.com" \
        -e "X_PROXY_PORT=80" \
        -e "X_PROXY_SCHEME=http" \
        -e "X_PATH=/jira" \
        acntech/adop-jira
```

Environment Variables:
`X_PROXY_NAME`      : Sets the connector proxy name (in this case `example.com`)
`X_PROXY_PORT`      : Sets the connector proxy port (in this case `80`)
`X_PROXY_SCHEME`    : Sets the connector scheme (in this case `http`).
`X_PATH`            : Sets the context path (in this case `/jira` so you would access JIRA http://localhost:8080/jira).

> IMPORTANT! This configuration will be only written to `${JIRA_INSTALL_DIR}/conf/server.xml` file once, when one or more of env variables are provided. Next time you stop/start container these parameters will be ignored.

You will also need to configure reverse proxy, _example_ of such configuration for _Nginx_ (which is running at same [Docker host and network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/) as JIRA) is:
```
server {
    listen                                  80;
    server_name                             example.com;
    location /jira {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host   $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass                          http://jira-software:8080;
        proxy_redirect                      off;
    }
}
```
### Alt 4: Run container with custom memory and plugin timeout properties

```console
$ docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d -p 8080:8080 --name jira \
      -v "/var/lib/docker/data/jira:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira" \
      -e "X_PROXY_NAME=example.com" \
      -e "X_PROXY_PORT=80" \
      -e "X_PROXY_SCHEME=http" \
      -e "X_PATH=/jira" \
      -e "CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -Datlassian.plugins.enable.wait=300" \
      acntech/adop-jira
```

Catalina properties:
`Xms` : JVM Minimum Memory (in this case 1 GB). [More information](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/increasing-jira-application-memory-749383419.html)
`Xmx` : JVM Maximum Memory (in this case 2 GB). [More information](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/increasing-jira-application-memory-749383419.html)
`atlassian.plugins.enable.wait` : Time in seconds JIRA waits for plugins to load eg. 300. [More information](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+applications+System+Plugin+Timeout+While+Waiting+for+Add-ons+to+Enable)

### Using external Oracle database
After container has started for the first time you can access JIRA Software UI at http://localhost:8080 and start initial setup. 
If you would like to use external Oracle 12c database, please take a look at [setup-jira-oracledb.sql](sql/setup-jira-oracledb.sql) and official [documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/connecting-jira-applications-to-oracle-802592181.html).

### Upgrade
    
Refer to [Upgrading JIRA applications manually](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/upgrading-jira-applications-manually-802592252.html)

To upgrade to a more recent version of JIRA Software you can simply stop the `jira`
container and start a new one based on a more recent Docker image:

    $> docker stop jira
    $> docker rm jira
    $> docker run ... (See above)

As your data is stored in the data volume directory on the host it will still be available after the upgrade.

> IMPORTANT: Please make sure that you **don't** accidentally remove the `jira`
container and its volumes using the `-v` option.
